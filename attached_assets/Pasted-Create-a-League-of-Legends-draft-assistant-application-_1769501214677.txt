Create a League of Legends draft assistant application called "DraftGenius AI" with the following requirements:

CORE FEATURES:
1. Draft Phase Interface
   - 5v5 draft simulation with ban phase (10 bans) and pick phase (10 picks)
   - Blue side and Red side team displays
   - Real-time champion selection interface
   - Timer simulation for each pick/ban phase

2. AI-Powered Recommendations
   - Suggest optimal bans based on:
     * Current meta win rates
     * Opponent team composition
     * High-priority picks
   - Suggest optimal picks based on:
     * Team synergy scores
     * Counter-pick relationships
     * Role requirements
     * Win rate statistics

3. Analytics Dashboard
   - Team composition strength meter (early/mid/late game)
   - Win probability calculator
   - Synergy score between selected champions
   - Counter-pick warnings and suggestions

4. Data Integration
   - Use mock GRID Esports API data for champion statistics
   - Store champion data including: name, role, win rate, pick rate, ban rate, counters, synergies
   - Implement search and filter functionality

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for modern, gaming-inspired UI
- Component structure:
  * DraftBoard (main container)
  * TeamPanel (blue/red side)
  * ChampionSelector (searchable champion grid)
  * RecommendationPanel (AI suggestions)
  * AnalyticsPanel (stats and metrics)
- Dark theme with blue/red accent colors
- Responsive design
- Smooth animations for picks/bans

UI/UX:
- League of Legends inspired design (dark, sleek, professional)
- Clear visual distinction between blue and red side
- Highlight recommended champions
- Show champion portraits with role icons
- Display real-time draft statistics

MOCK DATA:
Include at least 50 champions with realistic data:
- Champion name, role, image URL (use placeholder or LoL assets)
- Win rate, pick rate, ban rate (percentages)
- Counters array (which champions counter this pick)
- Synergies array (which champions work well with this pick)
- Tags (e.g., "engage", "poke", "scaling", "early-game")

AI LOGIC:
Implement simple but effective algorithms:
- Ban priority: highest win rate + pick rate champions
- Pick suggestions: best available counters to enemy team + synergy with your team
- Win probability: based on team comp balance, counter matchups, and meta strength
- Composition analysis: check for tank, damage, CC, engage/disengage balance

Start with the project setup and core draft interface, then add AI recommendations.
